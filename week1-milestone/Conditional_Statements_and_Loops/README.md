# Conditional Statements & Loops

- Write a program that asks for a digit and depending on the input shows the name of that digit (in English) using a switch statement.

- Write a program that converts a number in the range [0...999] to a text corresponding to its English pronunciation. Examples:

**0 => "Zero"**

**273 => "Two hundred seventy three"**

**400 => "Four hundred"**

**501 => "Five hundred and one"**

**711 => "Seven hundred and eleven"**

- Write a program that prints all possible cards from a standard deck of 52 cards (without jokers). 
  The cards should be printed with their English names. Use nested for loops and switch-case.
