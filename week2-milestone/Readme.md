# Week Two

### Project 2a: **Arrays & Numeral Systems**
____________
- Write a program that reads a rectangular matrix of size N x M and finds in it the square 3 x 3 that has the maximal sum of its elements.

- Write a program that creates an array containing all letters from the alphabet (A-Z). Read a word from the console and print the index of each of its letters in the array.

-Write a program that fills a matrix of size (N, N) and show same in the console (for N=4):

- Write a program to convert decimal numbers to their binary representation.

- Write a program to convert binary numbers to their decimal representation.

- Write a program to convert decimal numbers to their hexadecimal representation.

- Write a program to convert hexadecimal numbers to their decimal representation.




### Project 2b:

#### Methods and Recursion

- Write a program that can solve these tasks:

Reverses the digits of a number

Calculates the average of a sequence of integers

Solves a linear equation a * x + b = 0

        Create appropriate methods.

        Provide a simple text-based menu for the user to choose which task to solve.

                Validate the input data:

The decimal number should be non-negative

The sequence should not be empty

a should not be equal to 0


- Write a recursive program for generating and printing all permutations of the numbers 1, 2, ..., n for a given integer number n. Example:

        n=3 => {1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 2}, {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}, {3, 1, 2},{3, 2, 1}


- Write a recursive program that traverses the entire hard disk drive C:\ and displays all folders recursively and all files inside each of them.
